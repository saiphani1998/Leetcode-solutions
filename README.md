# Leetcode-solutions
Solutions for problems on Leetcode in Java

### Concepts learnt/revised
- Mathematical approach to solve problems
- When handelling with Integer objects, values out of range[-127 to 128] returns false when compared using '=='. So .equals() method should be used.
- Array Manipulations
- Kadane's algorithm to find maximum sum sub array.
- String manipulations
- KMP algorithm to for pattern searching.
- Concept, usage and applications of trie.
- Usage of binary search to optimise solutions
- Function recursions
- Playing with matrices
- Time complexities of in-built Java Data structures.
- Bit manipulations
- Newton's Method of approximation (to find if a given number is valid square or not).
