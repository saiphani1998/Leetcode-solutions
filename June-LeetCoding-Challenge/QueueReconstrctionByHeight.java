/*
* Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue.
* Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and
* k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h.
* Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.
* Note: The number of people is less than 1,100.
* Example:
    Input:
    [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
    Output:
    [[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
*
* Approach: Sort the elements on the basis of height and then arrange them according to the value of k.
