/*
* Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i,
* write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.
* Note:
    1 <= w.length <= 10000
    1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
    pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
* Example 1:
    Input:
    ["Solution","pickIndex"]
    [[[1]],[]]
    Output: [null,0]
* Example 2:
    Input:
    ["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
    [[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
    Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
* Explanation of Input Syntax:
    * The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments.
    * Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no arguments.
    * Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
*
* Approach: Since every integer is weighted, we need to get the total sum before we pick a point
    * The total sum does not exceed the integer max value, so we can use a int to store the sum
    * After creating accumulated sum array, we generate a random point, r, between [0, sum) and
        * perform binary search on this accumulated array.
