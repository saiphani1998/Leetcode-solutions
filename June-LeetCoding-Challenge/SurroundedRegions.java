/*
* Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
* A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
* Example:
    X X X X
    X O O X
    X X O X
    X O X X
    After running your function, the board should be:
    X X X X
    X X X X
    X X X X
    X O X X
* Explanation:
    * Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
    * Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
    * Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
