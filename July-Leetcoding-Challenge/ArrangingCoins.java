/*
* You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
* Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.
* n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
* Example 1:
    n = 5
    The coins can form the following rows:
    ¤
    ¤ ¤
    ¤ ¤
    Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
* Example 2:
    n = 8
    The coins can form the following rows:
    ¤
    ¤ ¤
    ¤ ¤ ¤
    ¤ ¤
    Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
